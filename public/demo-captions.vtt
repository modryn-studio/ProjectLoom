00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500
ProjectLoom turns one AI chat into a visual canvas of connected conversation cards.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Branch from any message to explore a different direction without losing your original thread.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Build multiple branches side by side so your ideas stay visible instead of buried in a single scroll.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Merge branches when you are ready. The AI sees both contexts and generates a unified plan.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Branch again from the merged node to challenge assumptions, review risks, and refine the outcome.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:11.000
Final merge: every thread, insight, and critique becomes one clear output you can act on.
