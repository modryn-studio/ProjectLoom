## Tagline

**Git for AI Conversations**

Transform linear AI conversations into spatial, branching project trees.

---

## Hero Section

### Primary Headline
**Visual Canvas for AI Conversations**

### Subheadline
Branch, merge, and organize your AI conversations like never before. Turn exploratory chats into structured knowledge.

---

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Exploratory AI Conversations
Branch to explore multiple approaches to the same problem

### 2. Decision Making
Use merge nodes to synthesize multiple conversation threads

### 3. Project Planning
Organize related conversations spatially on a canvas

### 4. Knowledge Building
Preserve decision points and context through branching

---

## Key Features

### Infinite Canvas
- Spatial organization of conversations
- Pan, zoom, and arrange cards freely
- Visual relationships through edges

### Branching & Merging
- Branch from any message in any conversation
- Create merge nodes to synthesize multiple threads
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure prevents cycles
- Full context inheritance

### Multi-Model Support
- Anthropic Claude (Opus 4, Sonnet 4, Haiku 4)
- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini)
- Vision support for all models
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

### Context Management
- Full parent context inheritance
- Per-parent context tracking in merge nodes
- Workspace-level knowledge base
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) support

### Keyboard-First Design
- Lightning-fast navigation
- Comprehensive shortcuts
- Power user optimized
- Mouse and keyboard workflows

---

## Value Propositions

### For Developers
"Stop losing brilliant ideas in linear chat histories. Branch when inspiration strikes, merge when clarity emerges."

### For Researchers
"Explore multiple hypotheses simultaneously. Your thought process becomes a visible, navigable tree."

### For Product Managers
"Turn explorations into decisions. Visualize trade-offs, preserve context, make informed choices."

### For Technical Writers
"Documentation emerges from conversation. Branch for details, merge for synthesis, export for sharing."

---

## How It Works

### 1. Start a Conversation
Create a card, choose your AI model, and start chatting.

### 2. Branch When Curious
See an interesting direction? Branch from any message to explore without losing your original thread.

### 3. Merge When Ready
Synthesize insights from multiple branches into a single merge node with full context from all parents.

### 4. Organize Spatially
Arrange cards on the canvas to match your mental model. Group related conversations, create visual hierarchies.

## FAQ Section

### Q: Do you store my API keys?
A: No. Keys are stored in your browser's localStorage only. We never see them.

### Q: What happens to my conversations?
A: Everything is stored locally in your browser. No data is sent to our servers.

### Q: Which AI models are supported?
A: Claude Opus/Sonnet/Haiku 4, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o Mini. All support vision.

### Q: Can I use it offline?
A: The app itself works offline, but you need internet to call AI APIs.

### Q: Is there a limit to branches or merges?
A: No limit on branches. Merge nodes support up to 5 parents for optimal AI performance.

### Q: Can I export my conversations?
A: Not yet, but export functionality is planned for a future release.

## Branding Notes

### Color Palette
- Navy background (#0a0e27)
- Violet accents for primary actions
- Amber for branches
- Emerald for merges
- Dark theme only

### Voice & Tone
- Technical but approachable
- Confident, not boastful
- Focus on user empowerment
- Avoid jargon where possible

### Key Differentiators
1. Spatial organization (not linear)
2. Full DAG support (not just trees)
3. Multi-model (not locked to one provider)
4. Privacy-first (local storage)
5. Keyboard-optimized (power users)
