# Marketing Principles

## Core Philosophy
- **Distribution is the product** — A great product with no distribution dies. A mediocre product with great distribution survives. Build marketing into the product, not on top of it.
- **You are not your user** — You will share your product because you built it. Real users need a reason. Give them one.
- **Earn attention, don't buy it** — Paid ads are a tax on products that aren't interesting enough to spread organically. Make something worth talking about first.

## The Hook Strategy
- **Lead with the bit, not the pitch** — The entry point should be fun, provocative, or useful on its own. The "real product" can reveal itself after. Nobody clicks "Sign up to manage your projects." They click "Roast my startup."
- **Every tool is a trojan horse** — Free utilities, generators, roasts, calculators — these exist to create the first touchpoint. The product comes second.
- **Give users something to share** — Before building, ask: *what would a user screenshot and post?* If you can't answer that, redesign the entry point. The share IS the ad.

## Virality
- **Attach your brand to the output** — When users share results, your name travels with it. Watermarks, URLs, "made with X" — zero cost distribution on every share.
- **Embarrassing and impressive both spread** — Content that makes users look vulnerable (a brutal roast) or impressive (a beautiful output) travels faster than neutral content. Aim for one of the two.
- **Cold-start bypass** — Don't launch a community. Launch a tool. Tools work on day one with zero users. Communities don't. Build the tool first; let the community emerge from the tool's output.

## Target Audience
- **Find the people who ship** — Builders, indie hackers, developers, and creators are the best first audience. They share obsessively, have influence in adjacent communities, and will promote you if you solve a real problem.
- **100 obsessed > 10,000 passive** — One user who tells five friends is worth more than a thousand who opened once and forgot. Optimize for passion, not reach.
- **Go where they already are** — X (tech/indie hacker), Reddit (r/SideProject, r/webdev), HackerNews, Discord servers. Don't build an audience from scratch — borrow existing ones.

## Launch Mechanics
- **Ship to a small, specific community first** — Validate signal before spending energy on a broad launch. A warm HN comment or a small subreddit reaction tells you more than 1,000 cold impressions.
- **Sequence your launches** — Small community → indie hacker platforms (PH, SOR) → broader social. Each stage builds proof for the next.
- **A launch is not a moment, it's a loop** — "Launched" doesn't mean done. Re-launch with each meaningful update, new use case, or milestone. Every win is a new launch.

## Content & Positioning
- **Show, don't describe** — A GIF of the product working beats three paragraphs of feature copy. Lead with the outcome, not the mechanism.
- **Name the pain before the solution** — Users don't buy products, they escape problems. Start with what's broken, then reveal the fix.
- **Plain language wins** — If you need jargon to explain it, you don't understand your user yet. "Branching AI conversations on an infinite canvas" → "Pick up any AI thread from where you left off, or go down a new one."

## Retention as Marketing
- **A product users miss is your best ad** — Word of mouth comes from loss aversion, not satisfaction. Build something people notice when it's gone.
- **The first session is the only session that matters for retention** — If users don't get to the aha moment in session one, they never come back. Obsess over that window.
- **Make sharing feel generous, not promotional** — Users share when it helps someone they know. Frame sharing as "you should try this" not "spread the word."
