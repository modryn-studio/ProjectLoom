# Demo Video Script — ProjectLoom

Last updated: February 22, 2026

**Scenario:** Going freelance as a UI/UX designer  
**Why this works:** Universal career decision, two genuinely different angles worth exploring, a plan worth reviewing, and a clear payoff when everything gets combined. Non-technical audience immediately understands the stakes.

**Runtime target:** 45–90 seconds of recording (can be cut down in editing)

## Card 1 — Root Card (auto-typed)

**User prompt:**
> I'm a UI/UX designer with 4 years of agency experience. I'm seriously thinking about going freelance. Is this a good move, and where do I even start?

**AI response:**
> Four years of agency experience is a strong foundation — you've got a portfolio, process knowledge, and exposure to real client work. Going freelance is absolutely viable from here.
>
> The two things that make or break this transition aren't talent — they're **pipeline** (do you have a way to find clients before you quit?) and **runway** (can you survive 3–6 months before income stabilises?).
>
> These are worth thinking through separately. Let's explore both.

## Card 2 — Branch A: Client Pipeline (auto-typed after user creates branch)

**User prompt:**
> How do I build a client pipeline before I quit my job?

**AI response:**
> The goal is to have paying work lined up — or at least warm leads — before you hand in your notice.
>
> **Start now, while employed:**
> - Tell 3–5 people in your network you're "taking on select freelance projects" — word of mouth is your best first channel
> - Post 2–3 case studies on LinkedIn and Dribbble this month. Clients Google you before they reach out.
> - Take one small project on the side. Even a $500 logo build proves you can operate independently.
>
> **Before you quit, aim to have:**
> - At least one paying retainer or a signed project contract
> - A simple portfolio site with a clear "hire me" CTA
> - A defined niche — "UI/UX for SaaS products" closes faster than "I do design"
>
> Two to three months of side-hustle groundwork can dramatically reduce the risk of your first 90 days.

## Card 3 — Branch B: Financial Planning (auto-typed after user creates second branch from root)

**User prompt:**
> How much money do I need saved, and how should I price my work?

**AI response:**
> **Runway:** Aim for 6 months of personal expenses saved before you quit. Calculate your monthly burn (rent, food, subscriptions, health insurance) and multiply by six. This is your safety net — not your spending money.
>
> **Pricing:**
> - With 4 years of agency experience, $75–$120/hr is a defensible range depending on your location and niche
> - Project-based pricing often earns more: a $5,000 website project at 40 hours = $125/hr effective rate
> - Retainers are gold — $2,000–$4,000/month for ongoing design support gives you predictable income
>
> **The first mistake most freelancers make:** underpricing to win work. You're not competing with offshore rates — you're selling expertise, communication, and reliability. Price accordingly.
>
> A single mid-sized client on retainer can replace your salary. That's your first goal.

## Card 4 — Merge 1: 90-Day Plan (auto-typed after user merges Branch A + Branch B)

**User prompt:**
> Combine the client pipeline strategy and the financial advice into a concrete 90-day action plan for making this transition.

**AI response:**
> Here's your 90-day freelance launch plan, built from both threads:
>
> **Month 1 — Build the foundation (while still employed)**
> - Calculate your 6-month runway number; start saving aggressively if you're not there yet
> - Publish 2 portfolio case studies on LinkedIn and Dribbble
> - Reach out to 5 former colleagues or clients: "I'm taking on freelance work — know anyone who needs design help?"
> - Take one small paid project to prove the model
>
> **Month 2 — Create optionality**
> - Launch your portfolio site with a hire-me page and clear niche statement
> - Aim for one signed contract or retainer before quitting
> - Open a separate business bank account; set up invoicing (Wave or HoneyBook)
>
> **Month 3 — Make the leap**
> - Hand in notice once you have runway + at least one client
> - Set a weekly revenue target ($X/week to cover expenses + reinvest)
> - Schedule one outreach touchpoint per day for the first 30 days post-quit
>
> **Success metric:** By day 90, you have one retainer client and a pipeline of 2–3 warm leads. Everything else is gravy.

## Card 5 — Branch C: Critical Review (auto-typed after user branches from Merge 1)
*(Optionally switch to a different model here — e.g. switch from Claude to GPT-4o to show the model selector)*

**User prompt:**
> Review this 90-day plan critically. What are the gaps, risks, and things I haven't thought about?

**AI response:**
> This is a solid foundation, but here are the gaps worth addressing:
>
> **What's missing:**
> - **Legal & contracts** — you have no mention of a client contract template. One client who doesn't pay can wreck your runway. Get a contract before you do any work.
> - **Tax planning** — as a freelancer you'll owe quarterly estimated taxes. Set aside 25–30% of every payment immediately or you'll face a nasty surprise in April.
> - **Health insurance** — this is often the #1 reason people don't go freelance. Price it out now; it's usually $300–$500/month depending on coverage.
>
> **Risks to the plan:**
> - The "one retainer client" milestone creates a single point of failure. If they churn, you're back to zero. Aim for 2–3 smaller clients over 1 large one.
> - Word of mouth is slow. The plan underinvests in outbound — consider cold email to 10 dream clients per week from day one.
>
> **Mindset gap:**
> - Freelancing is emotionally harder than it looks. Build in time for slow weeks — they will happen, and spiralling into anxiety kills productivity.

## Card 6 — Merge 2: Final Updated Plan (auto-typed after user merges Merge 1 + Branch C)

**User prompt:**
> Update the 90-day plan to address the gaps and risks identified in the review. Give me the complete, final version.

**AI response:**
> Here's the updated plan with all gaps addressed:
>
> **Month 1 — Build the foundation**
> - Calculate 6-month runway; hit that number before quitting
> - Publish 2 portfolio case studies; reach out to 5 past contacts
> - Take one paid project; use it to test a **client contract template** (free at HelloSign or Bonsai)
> - Research health insurance options and factor the cost into your pricing
>
> **Month 2 — De-risk the launch**
> - Launch portfolio site with niche focus
> - Target 2–3 clients at smaller retainers rather than one large one
> - Begin 10 cold outreach emails/week to ideal clients alongside warm referrals
> - Set up business banking + invoicing; configure 28% tax hold on every payment
>
> **Month 3 — Make the leap**
> - Quit once you have: runway ✓, 2 clients or signed contracts ✓, legal/financial structure ✓
> - Week 1 post-quit: send 50 outreach emails (blitz mode)
> - Build a weekly review habit: pipeline status, revenue vs target, one improvement
>
> **What's different from v1:**
> Legal structure and contracts are now week-1 tasks, not afterthoughts. Tax planning is built into pricing. Client concentration risk is explicitly managed. Outbound is scheduled, not aspirational.
>
> This is a plan you can actually execute — not just a list of good intentions.

## Clueso Transcript (Sync Points)

**1.** This is ProjectLoom — an AI canvas where each conversation lives as its own node. You type a question, the AI responds, and that exchange becomes a card you can build on.

**2.** Instead of a single linear chat, you can branch. One conversation splits into two independent threads — each exploring a different angle of the same problem, side by side on the canvas.

**3.** Branches aren't just for one level. You can keep going — add a second branch from the root, explore a completely separate direction, and watch the canvas grow organically around your thinking.

**4.** When two threads have run their course, you merge them. ProjectLoom pulls both conversations into context and generates a response that synthesises everything — no copy-pasting, no summarising yourself.

**5.** The merged result is just another node. You can keep branching from it — this time to challenge and pressure-test what you've built, using a different model if you want a different perspective.

**6.** One final merge closes the loop. Every thread, every insight, every critique — combined into a single output. That's the canvas: non-linear thinking, with AI that keeps up.

## Recording Notes

- **Canvas zoom level:** around 70–80% so 3–4 cards are visible at once
- **Cursor movements:** slow and deliberate between cards — let the viewer's eye follow
- **Branch moment:** right-click on a message → "Branch from here" — pause half a beat before clicking so it reads on screen
- **Model switch:** open the model selector on Card 5 before typing the prompt — just a 2-second visible interaction
- **Merge moment:** Shift-click both cards → floating bar appears → click Merge — this is the money shot, don't rush it
- **Do not show the API key setup modal** — use mock responses mode (no key needed)
- **Recommended resolution:** 1280×800 or 1440×900 — wide enough to show the canvas layout, not so wide the cards look tiny

## Implementation Notes (for dev mode)

- Use `?demo=record` URL flag to load this script into auto-type mode
- Each step pauses after AI response and waits for user action (branch/merge click)
- Model switch on Card 5 can be real UI interaction — just pre-select GPT-4o in the selector
- All responses served from `mock-responses.ts` keyed by demo step — no API key needed, no network latency
