# Demo Video Script - ProjectLoom

Last updated: February 23, 2026

**Scenario:** Difficult conversation with your manager about being passed over for promotion
**Why this works:** Universally relatable high-stakes situation, two genuinely different angles (rational preparation vs emotional composure), and a clear payoff when the merge synthesizes both into a single actionable plan. Non-technical audience immediately understands the stakes.

**Runtime target:** 30-60 seconds of recording (can be cut down in editing)
**Canvas structure:** 4 cards - tighter, punchier, more impactful than a 6-card tree.

## Canvas Structure

```
[Root: Passed over for promotion]
            |              |
     [Branch A]      [Branch B]
     Building         Staying
     the Case         Composed
            \            /
         [Merge: Conversation Plan]
```

## Card 1 - Root Card (auto-typed)

**Title:** Promotion Conversation

**User prompt:**
> I need to have a difficult conversation with my manager about being consistently passed over for promotion despite strong performance reviews. How do I approach this without damaging the relationship?

**AI response:**
> Being passed over despite strong reviews is genuinely difficult - and more common than it should be. The good news is this is a very winnable conversation if you approach it right.
>
> Two things will determine whether this goes well:
>
> **Your case** - what you say, the evidence you bring, and how you frame it. Most people either come in too emotional or too vague. You need neither.
>
> **Your composure** - how you handle their reaction in real time. Managers get defensive, deflect, or make vague promises. Your ability to stay grounded through that is what separates a productive conversation from a damaging one.
>
> These are worth preparing separately. Let's explore both angles.

## Card 2 - Branch A: Building the Case (auto-typed after user creates branch)

**Title:** Building the Case

**User prompt:**
> Help me prepare the direct case - what specifically should I say, what evidence should I bring, and how do I open the conversation?

**AI response:**
> Let's build a case that's hard to dismiss.
>
> **Opening line (memorize this):**
> *"I want to talk about my career trajectory here. I've had consistently strong reviews, and I want to understand what the path to promotion looks like for me specifically."*
>
> This is non-confrontational but direct. You're not accusing - you're asking for clarity.
>
> **Evidence to bring:**
> - Your last 2-3 performance reviews (pull exact quotes)
> - Specific examples of work that exceeded your current role's scope
> - Any metrics: revenue impact, team contributions, projects delivered
> - If peers were promoted, note what they had that you can demonstrate too
>
> **The structure that works:**
> 1. State the pattern: "I've been here X years with strong reviews each cycle"
> 2. Ask the question: "What specifically would I need to demonstrate to be promoted?"
> 3. Listen carefully - their answer reveals whether there's a real path or not
> 4. Pin it down: "Can we set a timeline and specific milestones so I can work toward this?"
>
> **The trap to avoid:** Don't compare yourself to others who got promoted. The moment you say "but they got promoted," the conversation becomes about them, not you.

## Card 3 - Branch B: Staying Composed (auto-typed after user creates second branch from root)

**Title:** Staying Composed

**User prompt:**
> How do I manage myself emotionally during this conversation? What if they get defensive or dismiss my concerns?

**AI response:**
> This is the part most people skip - and it's the part that actually decides how the conversation goes.
>
> **Before the meeting:**
> - Write down your worst-case fear (they say no, they get angry, they dismiss you). Now ask: *could I survive that?* Yes. You could. Naming the fear shrinks it.
> - Decide on your emotional floor: "No matter what happens, I will stay calm and professional." This is a commitment, not a hope.
>
> **During the conversation:**
> - **If they get defensive:** Don't match their energy. Pause, then say: *"I'm not trying to create conflict - I genuinely want to understand the path forward."*
> - **If they dismiss your concerns:** Don't argue. Ask a question instead: *"Help me understand - what would need to change for this to be the right time?"*
> - **If they make vague promises:** Pin it down gently: *"I appreciate that. Can we put a specific timeline on this so we're both aligned?"*
>
> **The physiological trick:**
> When you feel your heart rate spike, slow your speech by 30%. Deliberately. This sends a calm signal to your brain and forces you out of fight-or-flight. It also makes you sound more authoritative.
>
> **After the meeting:**
> Send a brief email summarizing what was discussed and any commitments made. This creates accountability without being aggressive.

## Card 4 - Merge: Conversation Plan (auto-typed after user merges Branch A + Branch B)

**Title:** Conversation Plan

**User prompt:**
> Combine the preparation strategy with the emotional management advice into a single conversation plan I can actually follow tomorrow.

**AI response:**
> Here's your complete conversation plan - preparation and composure woven together so you can actually follow this tomorrow.
>
> **1 hour before - Set the foundation**
> - Review your evidence packet: last 2-3 reviews, key achievements, scope-exceeding contributions
> - Read through your opening line once: *"I want to talk about my career trajectory here..."*
> - Do the fear-naming exercise: write your worst case, acknowledge you'd survive it, let it go
> - Commit to your emotional floor: calm, professional, no matter what
>
> **The conversation - Follow this structure**
>
> | Step | What you say | How you stay grounded |
> |------|-------------|----------------------|
> | **Open** | *"I want to understand the path to promotion for me specifically."* | Speak 30% slower than feels natural |
> | **Present evidence** | Share 2-3 specific achievements that exceed your current role | Stick to facts - no emotion, no comparison to peers |
> | **Ask the key question** | *"What specifically would I need to demonstrate?"* | Pause after asking. Let silence work for you. |
> | **Handle defensiveness** | *"I'm not trying to create conflict - I want to understand the path forward."* | If heart rate spikes, slow your speech further |
> | **Pin down next steps** | *"Can we set a timeline and milestones so I'm working toward something concrete?"* | Frame as collaboration, not ultimatum |
>
> **After the meeting - Lock it in**
> - Send a follow-up email within 2 hours summarizing commitments and timeline
> - If the conversation revealed there's no real path - that's valuable information too. You now know where you stand.
>
> **The insight that makes this work:** Your preparation gives you confidence to stay calm. Your calm gives you the clarity to use your evidence well. They reinforce each other - that's why both threads matter.

## Voiceover Script (Clueso)

No text overlays — the voiceover carries all context while the canvas stays clean.

> This is ProjectLoom — an AI canvas where each conversation lives as its own card.

*(root card appears, prompt types, AI responds)*

> Instead of one linear chat, you branch — two separate threads exploring different angles of the same problem.

*(branch A created and answered, branch B created and answered)*

> When you're ready, you merge. ProjectLoom pulls both threads into context and synthesises everything into a single response.

*(merge card appears, prompt types, AI responds with the full conversation plan)*

> Non-linear thinking, with AI that keeps up.

## Recording Notes

- **Canvas zoom level:** around 70-80% so all 4 cards are visible at once
- **Cursor movements:** slow and deliberate between cards - let the viewer's eye follow
- **Branch moment:** right-click on a message -> "Branch from here" - pause half a beat before clicking so it reads on screen
- **Merge moment:** Shift-click both cards -> floating bar appears -> click Merge - this is the money shot, don't rush it
- **No text overlays** - voiceover carries all context, canvas stays clean
- **Do not show the API key setup modal** - use mock responses mode (no key needed)
- **Recommended resolution:** 1280x800 or 1440x900 - wide enough to show the canvas layout, not so wide the cards look tiny

## Implementation Notes (for dev mode)

- Use `?demo=record` URL flag to load this script into auto-type mode
- Each step pauses after AI response and waits for user action (branch/merge click)
- All responses served from `mock-responses.ts` keyed by demo step - no API key needed, no network latency
- 4-card flow: root -> branch A -> branch B -> merge (3 user actions: branch, branch, merge)
