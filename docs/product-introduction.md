# ProjectLoom — What It Is (For Everyone)

## The Problem

You're chatting with AI, exploring ideas. You ask a question. The AI gives an answer. You go deeper on one angle. Then you think, "wait, I wonder what the answer would be if I approached this completely differently?"

You backtrack. You delete. You start over. The first thread is gone. Your thinking is lost.

Or you're trying to think through a complex problem — like launching a startup or writing a research paper. You want to explore three different angles in parallel. You can't. Linear chat forces you to pick one lane, finish it, then start over for the next one. By the time you're back to lane three, you've forgotten what you learned in lane one.

That's what ProjectLoom fixes.

## The Idea

At any point in a conversation, you can:
- **Branch** — take the conversation in a different direction without losing where you were
- **Explore** — go down that new path while the original stays exactly as it was
- **Merge** — pull the best thinking from multiple directions back together
- **Navigate** — see everything at once on a visual canvas, not buried in a scroll

Every conversation card sits where you put it. Every connection is visible. Your entire thinking history is mapped, not hidden.

## A Real Example

You're planning a side project launch in 30 days.

**Card 1 (the root):** "What's the fastest way to launch a side project?"

It branches into three directions:

**Card 2 (Branch A):** "Which tech stack should I use?" → AI suggests Next.js, you explore that deeply, ask follow-up questions, end up with a deployment plan.

**Card 3 (Branch B):** "Who are my first 10 users?" → You explore distribution strategy, validate product-market fit concerns, narrow down your niche.

**Card 4 (Branch C):** "How do I actually ship in 30 days?" → You dive into the timeline, dependencies, what to cut.

Now instead of having three separate conversations scattered across your chat history, you can see all three branches on the canvas at once. You realize Branch B (finding users) needs to inform Branch A (the tech stack). You create:

**Card 5 (Merge):** Pull insights from all three branches together. The AI sees the context from all three threads and synthesizes a comprehensive launch plan.

You can click on any card. Edit the original question. See how changes ripple through the branches. Everything is there. Nothing is lost.

## Why This Changes How You Think

1. **Spatial memory** — Your thinking becomes visual. You remember *where* an idea was, not just *that* you had it.

2. **Parallel exploration** — Explore three angles on the same problem simultaneously without losing any of them.

3. **Better synthesis** — When you merge branches, the AI sees all the context. Its answer is smarter because it knows what you explored and why.

4. **No more re-explaining** — In linear chat, you spend half the conversation re-explaining what you already covered. Here, the AI knows the full history of your thinking.

5. **Flexible thinking** — You can change your mind halfway through. Branch off in a new direction. The old one is still there if you want to come back.

## Who Uses It

- **Researchers & writers** — Explore multiple arguments, then synthesize them into a coherent piece
- **Product strategists** — Model different user segments, market angles, and GTM approaches in parallel
- **Developers** — Work through architectural decisions, try different approaches, merge the best parts
- **Indie hackers** — Validate ideas, plan launches, think through business models without losing threads
- **Anyone who thinks in "what if"** — If you've ever wanted to explore two directions at once, this is for you

## Privacy (Skip If You Want)

Everything runs in your browser. When you connect your Anthropic or OpenAI account, your credentials go directly from your browser to that provider — we never see them, store them, or touch them. Your conversations stay on your device. No login required. No data collection. This is your private thinking space.

## One More Thing

The demo you'll see on first visit is a real example: planning a product launch. Try branching from a message. Try connecting two branches. See how it feels to think this way. Then connect your AI account and start mapping your own thinking.

It's weird at first. Then it clicks. After that, linear chat feels limiting.
